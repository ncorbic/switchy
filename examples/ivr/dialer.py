#
# IVR Dialer demonstrates how to launch one or more outbound campaigns using
# FreeSWITCH or Sangoma NetBorder Appliance.
# IVR Dialer peformsn the following
#   1. Connect to Sangoma NetBorder VoIP Gateway
#   2. Load user defined IVRCallControl application that
#      will be in charge of the each connected call.
#   3. Accept user camapign configuration
#      Number of calls to dial, what did to user per call
#      Number of calls per sec
#   4. Call IVRCallControl applicatoin per call.
#
# All user logic should be defined in IVRCallLogic Class!
# The IVRCallLogic is defined in ivr_call_logic.py example.
