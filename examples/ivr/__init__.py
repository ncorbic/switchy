Example IVR

This package contains the following modules which contain example code for
developing a very simple IVR using switchy and FreeSWITCH:

call_logic.py:

- A switchy event processing app which defines the basic event
  processing logic required to process DTMF inputs, play back prompt-files
  and take call recordings.

- An example decorator implementation for registering DTMF sequence
  processing callbacks very similar to `flask` routes
  (http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/quickstart/#routing).

dialer.py:

- An example auto-dialer using the built-in `switchy.app.call_gen.Originator`
  with basic support for multi-campaign batch dialling.

WARNING:
    This code should by no means be considered production ready. It is
    meant to serve as an overly documented example of how to begin implementing
    an IVR application.

NOTES:
    - you can configure the arguments to `main` in dailer.py to adjust
      campaign settings and FreeSWITCH IP information.
